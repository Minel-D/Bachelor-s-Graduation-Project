# Smart Newborn Monitor (IoT-Based)

> **Note:** This project was developed as my **Bachelor's Graduation Project** in [2024]. It serves as an archive to demonstrate my background in mobile application development and IoT integration.

## 📱 Project Overview
This is a native Android application developed with **Kotlin**, designed to help parents monitor their newborn's status in real-time. The app acts as a bridge between hardware sensors and the user, visualizing vital data (such as ambient temperature) to ensure the baby's safety. It represents a prototype of a smart baby monitoring system.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Kotlin-Java
* **IDE:** Android Studio
* **UI Framework:** Jetpack Compose (Modern UI Toolkit)
* **Networking:** Retrofit (REST API integration)
* **Hardware Integration:** IoT Sensor Data Handling

## ✨ Key Features
* **Real-Time Monitoring:** Fetches and displays instant data (e.g., temperature) from baby monitoring sensors.
* **Emergency Action:** One-tap emergency call button (integrates with Android Intent to dial 112/Emergency services).
* **API Integration:** Uses Retrofit to communicate with the backend/hardware interface.
* **Modern UI:** Built with declarative UI patterns using Jetpack Compose.
